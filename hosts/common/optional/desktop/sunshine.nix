# Sunshine — game-stream host for playtesting from the laptop.
#
# Streams the workstation's live Mango session to Moonlight on laptop-nixos over wg0.
# Purpose-built low-latency video (H.264/HEVC/AV1 via the RX 9070 XT hardware encoder),
# chosen over waypipe/RDP for remote playtest feel — Claude builds on the workstation,
# this streams the app when it's launched. Imported by hosts/workstation only.
#
# First-run setup (once): open Sunshine's web UI at https://10.100.0.1:47990 (self-signed
# cert warning is expected) and create a web-UI username/password. In Moonlight on the
# laptop, add the host by IP 10.100.0.1 (mDNS/avahi discovery does not traverse wg0), then
# enter the PIN Sunshine shows to pair. Everything below is wg0-only.
