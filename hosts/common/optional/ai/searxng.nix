# SearXNG — self-hosted metasearch for the AI lab (web search for agents/Open WebUI).
# wg0-only, served via uwsgi. Secret key generated off-git (never in the repo).
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS AN API-BACKED INSTANCE, NOT A WEB-SCRAPING ONE, and that is the
# whole design after 2026-08-31. Every commercial engine that works by scraping
# refuses this host: measured, four of them say so outright (duckduckgo CAPTCHA,
# brave "too many requests", mojeek and qwant "access denied"), and Bing does
# NOT — it silently serves ten unrelated results instead. Full diagnosis,
# including eleven refuted hypotheses, in docs/searxng-engines-degraded.md.
#
# The reputation is attached to the traffic PATTERN, not to any request
# attribute: curl and httpx from this same host, with any user-agent and any
# parameters, get correct results every time. So there is nothing to tune. The
# engines that work are the ones that expect robots — documented APIs.

    # ⚠️ DO NOT SET `package = pkgs.unstable.searxng`. IT TAKES THE SERVICE DOWN,
    # and it did on 2026-08-31 — a total outage, HTTP 500 on every route
    # including the root page, from a one-line change whose own comment called
    # it optional hygiene.
    #
    # WHY IT BREAKS. The NixOS module builds uwsgi's interpreter from the STABLE
    # `python3` (3.13.15) and expects `cfg.package` to live inside that env.
    # `pkgs.unstable.searxng` is built against python **3.14**, so it lands in a
    # different site-packages tree that the vassal's PythonHome never sees. The
    # symptom is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'searx'`, followed by
    # `no app loaded. going in full dynamic mode` — uwsgi stays UP and serves
    # 500s, so the unit reads `active` throughout. Measured: the vassal env's
    # site-packages contained 0 files matching searx.
    #
    # The lab's `pkgs.unstable.*` pattern works for ollama-rocm and sunshine
    # because those are standalone binaries. It does NOT transfer to a module
    # that constructs its own Python environment: the package and the
    # interpreter have to come from the same nixpkgs.
    #
    # Nothing was lost by reverting. The version bump was never the fix —
    # bing.py's result-extraction XPath is byte-identical between 2026-05-16 and
    # 2026-07-26 — and the engine list below is what actually repairs search. If
    # a newer SearXNG is ever genuinely wanted, it needs the whole module moved
    # to unstable (`services.searx` from nixpkgs-unstable), not one package
    # swapped underneath a stable module.

        # consumer actually makes. Measured on the live instance: a default
        # query returned 5 results from wikispecies alone, while
        # `categories=science` returned ~95 across 8 engines.

        # returns 10 results when named. So per-engine probes cannot tell an
        # enabled engine from a disabled one, and cannot see the default path at
        # all. The sentinel now checks the default path as well.
