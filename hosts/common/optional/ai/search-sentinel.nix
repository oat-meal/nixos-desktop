# Search relevance sentinel — asserts the lab's SearXNG actually searches.
#
# Runs ai-lab/sentinel/search-sentinel.py against 10.100.0.2:8888 twice a day.
# READ-ONLY: it issues search queries and inspects the answers, nothing else.
# Imported by hosts/server only (that is where SearXNG runs).
#
# ⚠️ WHY A LIVENESS CHECK WAS NOT ENOUGH, which is the entire reason this file
# exists. On 2026-08-31 SearXNG was up, answering in 0.8 s, HTTP 200, JSON API
# exactly as configured — and returning Social Security pages for a query about
# an African tree genus. The dashboard's `siteMonitor` on port 8888 was green
# throughout and would be green today against a service that had stopped
# searching entirely. See docs/searxng-engines-degraded.md.
#
# The check is RELEVANCE: ask for a rare binomial, require it to appear in the
# results. A `200 OK` over content nobody inspected is not a verdict.
