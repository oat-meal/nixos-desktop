# ComfyUI — workstation image-generation render node (podman, ROCm 7.2 / gfx1201, RX 9070 XT).
#
# A dedicated second ComfyUI on the workstation's discrete GPU, separate from the
# server's gfx1151 instance (../ai/comfyui.nix). This gives image generation a fast,
# dedicated GPU and takes it OFF the shared server GPU (so Ollama and image gen stop
# contending). Imported by hosts/workstation only. See docs/ai-lab.md for the wider
# image-generation capability and its consumers.
#
# Bound to LOOPBACK **and** wg0. On-box consumers (bench scripts, smoke test) address
# 127.0.0.1; the Open WebUI image-gen tool runs on the server and reaches this node at
# 10.100.0.1:8188 over the mesh. Both publish rules are needed — dropping the loopback
# one would break ai-lab/bench/*.sh and ai-lab/smoke-test, which hardcode 127.0.0.1.
#
# Data: the full ComfyUI tree (core + custom_nodes code + models) lives on the
# storage/comfyui dataset, rsynced from the server — see the deploy notes below.

    # RDNA4 stability: ComfyUI sees the HIP/ROCm card as "cuda:0" (HIP impersonates
    # CUDA), so it auto-enables two Nvidia-only optimizations — async multi-stream
    # weight offloading and pinned host memory — which trigger a GPU coredump on
    # gfx1201 during the heavy tiled SD-upscale stage (UltimateSDUpscale re-diffusing
    # 1024x1024 tiles). Base render + FaceDetailer survive; the upscale faulted hard.
    # Disabling both makes the full hi-res/detail/upscale pipeline complete cleanly
    # (verified 2026-06-20: 86s end-to-end, no coredump). hipBLASLt/MIOpen env-var
    # workarounds did NOT help — the offload path is the real cause. We override the
    # entrypoint (the image WORKDIR is /opt/ComfyUI) to inject the two flags.
    #
    # --reserve-vram keeps 2 GiB of the 16 GiB card away from ComfyUI for the OS. This
    # GPU is not a headless accelerator — it also drives the desktop, so a workflow that
    # legitimately allocates every last byte freezes the compositor while behaving
    # perfectly correctly. That is the COMMON freeze, and this is its fix.
    #
    # Note it would NOT have prevented the 2026-08-16 driver wedge: a dead-but-unreaped
    # KFD context keeps whatever it had already allocated, reservation or not. Two
    # different failures — this bounds normal operation, the sentinel reports the bug.
