# Fleet Health Sentinel — nightly LLM triage of wg0 fleet health.
#
# Runs ai-lab/sentinel/sentinel.py as oat on the server: collects a health
# snapshot from all three hosts over wg0, has the local qwen3 MoE triage it
# against docs/audit/known-states.md, and writes a severity-ranked report to
# /var/lib/fleet-sentinel/latest.md (plus a journal summary; optional ntfy push).
# READ-ONLY — it never changes any host. Imported by hosts/server only.
