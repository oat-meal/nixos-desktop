# ntfy — self-hosted notification hub for the lab (wg0-only, no public relay).
#
# The lab's private push channel: Claude Code session hooks, the fleet-sentinel,
# and backup checks POST to the `lab-alerts` topic here; the desktops subscribe
# and bridge each message into Noctalia via notify-send (see the mango autostart
# in home/common/optional/desktop/mango/home.nix). Imported by hosts/server.
#
# Publish:   curl -H "Title: ..." -H "Priority: high" -d "body" http://10.100.0.2:2586/lab-alerts
# Web UI:    http://10.100.0.2:2586  (over wg0)
