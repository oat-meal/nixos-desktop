# Weekly flake-update advisor (read-only).
#
# Runs ai-lab/update-advisor/update_advisor.py as oat: on a throwaway copy of the
# flake it runs `nix flake update`, diffs which direct inputs would bump, and asks
# qwen3 for a risk briefing tuned to this AMD ROCm + gaming lab. Writes a report
# and pings the ntfy hub when updates are available. Never touches the real flake
# or switches anything. Imported by hosts/server (always-on → the timer fires).
