# Runs ai-lab/smoke-test/smoke_test.py as oat on the workstation: a 1-token Ollama
# generation (gfx1151) + a tiny ComfyUI image gen (gfx1201). Alerts the lab ntfy
# hub if either fails — catches the documented fragility (a flake update breaking
# ollama-rocm or the RDNA4 ComfyUI image) before you hit it. Imported by the
# workstation (it can reach Ollama over wg0 + ComfyUI on loopback).
