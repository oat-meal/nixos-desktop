# GPU wedge sentinel — detects an unrecoverable amdgpu/KFD compute hang.
#
# Failure this exists for (first seen 2026-08-16, workstation-nixos): a ComfyUI worker
# died mid-workflow inside the ROCm/KFD driver. Its main thread became a zombie but a
# second thread stuck in D state (uninterruptible sleep in the driver), so the process
# could never be reaped. Consequences, in order:
#
#   1. KFD kept attributing the dead process's VRAM allocation to it — 15.8 of 15.9 GiB
#      pinned by a process that no longer existed.
#   2. `kworker/*+kfd_restore_wq` spun in D state forever retrying queue evict/restore.
#   3. `podman rm -f` could not remove the container ("given PID did not die within
#      timeout"), so podman-comfyui-render restart-looped every 30s.
#   4. With ~0 free VRAM the compositor and any running game had nothing to allocate:
#      the desktop appeared completely frozen while the machine itself was healthy
#      (load 3.3, PSI ~0, SSH instant).
#   5. `systemctl reboot` then HUNG at "generating shutdown ramfs" — the kernel cannot
#      quiesce a task wedged in the driver. Recovery needed SysRq (Alt+SysRq+S, then B)
#      or the power button.
#
# This sentinel cannot FIX any of that — nothing in userspace can clear a D-state task,
# and SIGKILL is already spent by the time we see it. Its whole job is to convert a
# baffling "my machine froze, is the hardware dying?" into a push notification that
# names the cause and the remedy, so the recovery is a forced reboot done knowingly
# rather than a blind power-cycle.
#
# Detection is deliberately conservative — a kfd kworker in D for a moment is NORMAL
# under load. We alert only when BOTH signals hold across two samples 60s apart:
#   * a kfd kworker is in D state, AND
#   * the discrete GPU's VRAM is >95% used.
# A healthy busy render trips at most one of these, and never both for a full minute.
#
# Alerts to the lab ntfy hub on the server. Per postmortem action item #3 that means it
# cannot report a workstation wedge while the server is down — accepted here, since the
# symptom (frozen desktop) is already impossible to miss locally; the alert adds the
# diagnosis, not the discovery.
