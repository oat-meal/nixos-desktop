# Post-rebuild / post-boot health verifier (read-only).
#
# After each activation (nixos-rebuild switch, or boot), schedule a transient
# check ~90s later that looks for failed systemd units and, if any, pushes an
# alert to the lab ntfy hub. Catches regressions from ANY rebuild regardless of
# how it was triggered — e.g. the case where a container silently failed to start
# after a switch. `systemctl --failed` lists only genuinely-failed units, so
# slow-starting services (ComfyUI) that are still "activating" are not flagged.
#
# Imported by every host.
