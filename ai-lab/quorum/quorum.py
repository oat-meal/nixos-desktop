"""Model quorum — ask several local models the same question independently, then
reconcile their answers: agreement raises confidence, disagreement is flagged.
The point is cross-referencing to reduce hallucinations, not debate.

Stdlib only. Talks to Ollama's HTTP API over the WireGuard mesh.

Usage:
    OLLAMA_HOST=10.100.0.2:11434 python3 quorum.py "your question"
    python3 quorum.py --members qwen2.5:7b,llama3.3:70b "your question"
