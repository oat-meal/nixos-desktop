"""AI Lab OpenAPI tool server.

Exposes the local lab tools (model quorum, document RAG, deep web research) as
OpenAPI endpoints so Open WebUI's tool-calling (and any OpenAPI client) can invoke
them. Each tool shells out to the existing `ai-lab/*` CLI via interpreter + script
paths passed in the environment (set by the NixOS module). wg0-only.

The host-health tools are intentionally NOT here — they need system privileges and
live in the Claude Code MCP instead.
